Module 2 - Stock Analysis
#Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to present to Steve stock performances for 2017 vs. 2018 to make decisions to present to his parents.   A larger set of data was needed to loop through for better analysis.   Refactoring code was an essential task in this process since the smaller data was performed and needed to expand to all stocks to make discoveries more robust.

**Results:

Stock performance 2017 vs. 2018
