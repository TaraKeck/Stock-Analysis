# Stock-Analysis
Module 2 - Stock Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
The purpose of this project was to present to Steve stock performances for 2017 vs. 2018 to make decisions to present to his parents.  A larger set of data was needed to loop through for better analysis.   Refactoring code was an essential task in this process since the smaller data was performed and needed to expand to all stocks to make discoveries more robust.

# RESULTS

Images below represent analysis of 2017 vs. 2018 stock performance:

# SUMMARY

1.) What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  - The advantages of refactory code is to build upon existing code for expanding needs.   It is also advantageous to refactor code for overall efficiencies, cleaner code, writing in notes and improved running times for large sets of data.
  - The disadvantages of refactoring is that if there is a current task or job and the person originally on the project did not insert comments, it's diffcult to refactor which will add unexpected time on a job/project that was not anticipated.

2.) How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
  - Pros:  The original VBA script was well written and contained notes that were clear.
  - Cons:  I had to pay close attention to the way I labeled the original sheets as I encountered some errors.
